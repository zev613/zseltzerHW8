The game.py module has one function, main. The main function takes no parameters. This function runs the game
itself, while slidingpuzzle.py has the class. First, it gets the row and column as input from user. It creates an instance of the SlidingPuzzle class, board.
The user selects the difficulty, either 1,2 or 3. The program then scrambles the board depending on the difficulty chosen.
The module then loops until the board is equal to the solved board. Each iteration, the user selects a row and column, until they are a legal move. 
The program does the move. This continues until the board is solved. It congratulates the user and prints out the board using the displayPuzzle method of the SlidingPuzzle class.

To run the code: 
python game.py
